# Pig dice game

This is my first attempt at applying what I've learned of DOM manipulation in a small project from [Jonas Schmedtmann's Complete JavaScript course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course).

His version of the project can be seen [here](https://pig-game-v2.netlify.app/)

The game logic is outlined in the flow-chart below. Using it as a guideline, I tried to complete the project without other instruction or coding-along. I was able to replicate the desired functionality, however my methods are inefficient and structuring needs work. I plan to optimize the code using further guidance from the course.

# Demo

Note: only the JS was coded from scratch; the index and stylesheet were provided as templates in the course. However I did implement a modal window for the player-winning condition.
