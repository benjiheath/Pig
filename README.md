# Pig dice game

This is my first attempt at applying what I've learned of DOM manipulation in a small project from [Jonas Schmedtmann's Complete JavaScript course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course).

His version of the project can be seen [here](https://pig-game-v2.netlify.app/)

The game logic is outlined in the flow-chart below. Using it as a guideline, I tried to complete the project without other instruction or coding-along and was able to replicate the desired functionality with the addition of a modal window, however my methods were inefficient and my structuring needed work. This version can be seen in the secondary branch.

Final version was improved using further guidance from the course. Here I utilized an array for better score tracking, which also enabled me to structure my button listeners much more cleanly.

# Demo

Note: only the JS was coded from scratch; the index and stylesheet were provided as templates in the course.
